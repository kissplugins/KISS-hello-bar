**KISS = Keep It Simple (Stupid)** Plugins are designed to do one thing only. And we believe that one thing should be done very well.

The **KISS Hello Bar** plugin (BETA) does not have any upsell or freemium features. You get it all.

## Instructions for Using the **KISS Hello Bar Plugin**

### **1. Install and Activate the Plugin**
1. Download the `KISS Hello Bar Plugin` file (if not already installed).
2. Go to your WordPress admin dashboard and navigate to **Plugins > Add New**.
3. Click **Upload Plugin** and upload the `.zip` file.
4. Once uploaded, click **Activate Plugin**.

### **2. Access the Plugin Settings**
1. Go to the **Settings > Hello Bar** menu in the WordPress admin dashboard.
2. Alternatively, click the **Settings** link directly in the **Plugins** list under the "KISS Hello Bar Plugin" entry.

---

### **3. Configure the Hello Bar**
On the settings page, you'll see two columns for easy navigation of options.

- **Display Options:**
  - **Display Hello Bar at Top of Pages**: Check this box to show the hello bar at the top of your site.
  - **Display Also on Footer**: Check this box to also display the hello bar at the bottom of your site.

- **Content Options:**
  - **Message**: Enter the text you want to display in the hello bar. The default message is:
    *"This is your KISS Hello Bar Plugin message."*
  - **Message Bar Background Color**: Use the color picker to select the background color of the hello bar.
  - **CTA Button Label**: Enter the label for the button (e.g., "Learn More").
  - **CTA Button Link**: Enter the URL where users will be redirected when they click the button.
  - **CTA Button Color**: Use the color picker to select the button's background color.

- **Save Changes**: Once you're done configuring the options, click the **Save Changes** button at the bottom of the page.

### **4. View and Troubleshoot the Hello Bar**
- After saving the settings, visit your site to see the hello bar displayed at the top and/or bottom of the page based on your configuration.
- If you do not see your updates after saving, clear both your **browser cache** and any **server-side cache** (e.g., caching plugins or hosting-level cache).
- Open the website in **Incognito Mode** (or Private Browsing mode) to ensure you’re viewing the most recent changes as visitors would.

---

### **5. Admin Toolbar Compatibility**
- If you're logged in as an admin (or any role with the WordPress admin toolbar enabled), the hello bar automatically adjusts to avoid overlapping the toolbar.

---

### **6. Disable the Hello Bar**
- To disable the hello bar, uncheck both **Display Hello Bar at Top of Pages** and **Display Also on Footer** options and save the settings.

---

### **Notes:**
- The plugin works on all front-end pages of your site.
- Any changes made in the settings are applied site-wide immediately after saving.
- If you encounter any issues, deactivate and reactivate the plugin to reset the settings to defaults.
